Zealots effect on opinion dynamics on complex networks
**Vahid Moeinifar, Semra Gündüç**

In this project, we study zealots’ effects on social networks. Our social network is based on
Scale-free networks using Barabasi Albert method and random networks using Erdős–Rényi method. We
used a pre-studied modified Voter model that includes zealots, individuals that never change their opinions.
We chose prominent individuals (i.e. hubs) as zealots. In this way we first chose important individuals with
high degree (hubs); second, individuals with high closeness. And then examined the consensus time
compared with that zealots are chosen as non-important individuals. We found that the time to get to the
consensus state in social networks is the same as different numbers of zealots but with the same degrees of
contamination with zealotry. For example, one zealot’s effect with a degree of 64 is same to 8 zealots’ effects
with a degree of 8.
